    <h4>Hiphop</h4>
    <p>My passion is dance .

        I have always been very passionate about dance because I’m very talented and I find it very easily to
        understand.
        I’ve been doing hip-hop dance since I was 3 years old .
        My family members Introduce me to dance . My mother inspires me the most during this Journey .

    </p>


    <p>I have been on three different hip-hop teams and I am been a cheerleader .

        I found my passion in a very young age , I know when I started to watch Beyoncé performances .
        My mother continues to inspire me with dance because she still is a dancer to this day on . </p>
