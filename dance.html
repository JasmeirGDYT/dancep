<h4>Hiphop</h4>
<p>My passion is dance . 

    I have always been very passionate about dance because I’m very talented and I find it very easily to understand. 
    I’ve been doing hip-hop dance since I was 3 years old .
    My family members Introduce me to dance . My mother inspires me the most during this Journey . 
   
   </p>


   <p>I have been on three different hip-hop teams and I am been a cheerleader . 

    I found my passion in a very young age , I know when I started to watch Beyoncé performances .
    My mother continues to inspire me with dance because she still is a dancer to this day on . </p>
